# Tournant
Gourmand/Gourmet recipe parser

Tournant serves your favorite dishes on your Android device!  
With Tournant, you can open XML recipe files from [Gourmand Recipe Manager](https://github.com/GourmandRecipeManager/gourmand) (previously known as Gourmet Recipe Manager).

## Installation
You can get your copy from different repositories:
- With an F-Droid compatible client (recommended)<br/>
<a href="https://zimbelstern.eu/fdroid/repo"><img alt="Official repository" src="https://zimbelstern.eu/badge.svg" style="height: 80px"/></a>
<a href="https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/repo"><img alt="IzzyOnDroid" src="https://gitlab.com/IzzyOnDroid/repo/-/raw/master/assets/IzzyOnDroid.png" style="height: 80px"/></a>
- Alternatively, you can download the latest APK directly from <https://tournant.zimbelstern.eu/tournant-latest.apk>

## How to get recipes on your device
Tournant can only read recipe files created by the desktop application Gourmand and is (currently) read-only.
- In Gourmand Recipe Manager, navigate to `File -> Export all recipes` or press `Ctrl + Shift + T`
- Choose `Gourmet XML file format` and give the file the extension `.xml` or `.grmt`
- Push the file to the external storage of your Android device, either manually or by using file synchronisation
- Open Tournant and choose your file
