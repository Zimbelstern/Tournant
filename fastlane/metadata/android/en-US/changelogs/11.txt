Tournant 2.0 comes with a completely rewritten codebase, paving the way for in-app recipe editing.
The mode setting (standalone or synced) was moved to the app settings. Editing features will be added gradually after this release.
With this version, there are already many improvements to the app: Much faster loading times, better display of amount ranges, import of multiple files, and many more.
